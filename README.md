Hello stranger

This is a public repo but you probably won't find much of interest to you.  I recommend you go for the original at

HI Rob

This is 21 March 2024 Rob, trying to get this repo to:

1. Replace `art.robnugen.com` extension on wiki.robnugen.com
2. Work in PHP 8.1 and Mediwiki 1.34
3. Minimally change original repo for art.robnugen.com extension to match what ends up working here

Local Lemur:

```
cd ~/work/rob/examples_for_wiki.rn.com
./scp_modified_files_to_dh_wiki.sh
```

Dreamhost:

```
ssh wiki
cd ~/wiki.robnugen.com/w/extensions/examples
```
